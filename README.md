# Survey Form Project

This is a simple Survey Form created as part of my learning process at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It is a responsive web form built using HTML and CSS. The form is designed to collect user data in a structured way.

## Features:
- Structured form layout for easy user interaction
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Validations for required fields

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS (External)

## How to Run:
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the survey form.

## Learnings:
This project helped me practice:
- HTML form elements like text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns.
- External CSS for styling and responsive design.
- Structure and layout of a simple form-based webpage.

## Future Improvements:
- Add JavaScript validation for dynamic form feedback.
- Improve design responsiveness across all device sizes.
